# ðŸ“º Netflix Data Analysis and Visualization Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the Netflix content dataset ranging from 2008 to 2021. The dataset includes movies, TV shows, and original content available on Netflix, providing an excellent opportunity to practice data preprocessing and derive meaningful insights using Python, SQL, and Tableau.

## ðŸ§° Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python** â€“ Data preprocessing and analysis (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ For presenting the code and workflow

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

## ðŸ”§ Data Cleaning Steps
1. **Null Handling** â€“ Treated missing/null values in key columns like `Director`, `Cast`, and `Country`.
2. **Duplicate Removal** â€“ Identified and dropped duplicate records.
3. **Missing Row Imputation** â€“ Populated important missing rows where possible.
4. **Column Dropping** â€“ Removed irrelevant columns such as `date_added_raw`.
5. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Split combined columns (e.g., duration, date) into separate meaningful fields.
6. **Standardization** â€“ Cleaned up text fields (title casing, trimming spaces, standard naming).

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations
Created an interactive Tableau dashboard showcasing:
- Content trends by year
- Country-wise content distribution
- Genre breakdown
- Movie vs. TV Show proportions
- Top directors and actors

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Netflix significantly increased its content library post-2015.
- The United States and India contributed the most content.
- Dramas and Comedies are the most frequent genres.
- Majority of content added are Movies compared to TV Shows.

## ðŸ§  Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience with real-world dataset cleaning using SQL and Python.
- Improved data wrangling techniques including handling of nulls, duplicates, and feature engineering.
- Developed storytelling skills using Tableau to convey insights visually.
